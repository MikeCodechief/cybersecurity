While I am still completing Google Cybersecurity certificate, This repo will have more update in the future.
I jsut fork GhostESP for creating a new version of hardware based on using ESP32-C3 with 1.8 TFT LCD and add GPS as new version of GhostESP

The new update for this repo will make it more closer to ESP Marauder
